        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Joanna, an aspiring full-stack developer with a passion for creating websites. My love for web development began during my 
          final year at university, when I created my first webpage and instantly knew this was what I wanted to pursue. My BEng in Robotics has 
          equipped me with strong problem-solving skills and technical expertise, which I bring to every project. I'm currently expanding my 
          knowledge in full-stack development and enjoying every moment of the journey!</p>

      <div class="offer">
        <h1>What I offer</h1>
        <p>I currently work full-time as a care assistant, where I’ve honed strong communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills—qualities 
          that are essential in any field. In my spare time, I’m fully committed to studying full-stack development, focusing on mastering both 
          front-end and back-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and databases like MongoDB and SQL.
        </p>

        <p>I’ve already built several web projects, including a personal portfolio, which have strengthened my understanding and hands-on experience. I’m eager to make a career switch and bring my 
          dedication, technical expertise, and passion for innovation to a full-stack development role. My goal is to contribute to impactful 
          projects, continuously grow as a developer, and become an invaluable asset to my future team.
