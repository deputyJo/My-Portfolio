        <h1>Bio</h1>

        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Joanna, an aspiring full-stack developer with a background in Robotics. My technical foundation, paired 
          with a genuine passion for web development, drives me to create intuitive and effective digital solutions. While my current role as a 
          care assistant has honed my communication and teamwork skills, my true focus is on mastering full-stack development.
        </p>

        <p>I’m committed to continuously expanding my knowledge in both front-end and back-end technologies. This portfolio showcases some of the 
          projects I’ve developed as part of my journey to transition into a full-time development role. I’m excited about the opportunities ahead 
          and look forward to contributing my skills to innovative and impactful projects.
        </p>

        <p>When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, refining my problem-solving abilities, and planning the next 
          steps in my development career.
        </p>

        <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio—I’m eager to connect and explore how I can contribute to your team.
